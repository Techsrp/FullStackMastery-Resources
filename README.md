IN PROGRESS - CHECK BACK LATER 

# FullStackMastery-Resources
    

### Purpose:  A guide to improving your skills in Full Stack Software / Web Devlopment.
About me: After writing my first lines of code while taking a basic tutorial on Codecademy in January of 2017 it was about 1 year later when I was fully employed in a stable job as a Full Stack Software developer at a good wage. To do that I became proficient. Proficiency and Mastery are two different things so this guide is dedicated to the latter. To make Senior I must become a master at my craft. I set the goal to master my craft within 5 years and to become an expert.  Just doing my work each day is not going to be enough I thought so I made this project to help me and figured others would benefit as well. 

**This is just a resource I do not claim ownership of anything on here.  

##### Skill: Workflow
This is intended to be the first most basic steps> If something is unfamilar ebleive me you will not want to skip over it. I have sat next to a 7 year veteran Senior dev and he did not know some of these keys 
Text Editor (IDE integrated development environment)
CTRL + A Selects all
CTRL + C ULTIMATE KEY OF ALL copy surprisingly high nuer of previous non coders dont reallu use this unless really good on a computer right lcik copy is super slow )
CTRL + V Paste 
SHIFT UP ARROW  move the line up or down not sure what this key is yet look it up
CTRL + D (esp useful remember to use Home and End keys to dynamically scroll to end or beginning of the lines text dynamically)
CTRL + ?/ (after selecting a block of code this will comment or uncomment if commented out the whole block or line) 


Code snippets
for example 
<li*  turns into <li 3x etc 

Git or version control
99% of the commands I actually use in dev on the job ( not implying this is what should be or is done by others or even is the best set at all just plainly what I happen to use and sure it will evolve)
git add .
git commit -m "my message here"
git push 
git stash 
git stash apply
git merge
git reset HEad 
git log
git status
git checkout <brancname>
git checkout -b creates new branch fro one currently on - so use a development branch and each time start a new branch for     each fauter then merge it back to dev. and rebase before pushing 
  some others and linek to books and huge git hub repo of them 
git bisect 
git remote -v 
git pull
git log
git push --set-upstream origin nss-react-edit-billing

WARNING PERSONAL SOAP BOX feel free to skip or not :
if you ever heard the joke ... I did from my CTO and Senior and other Junior Devs 2 or 4 spaces so I did some reaserch and top repos use 2 and 4 there are pros and cons to each. My philosophy is that I could careless jsut let the comoaony decide and if you are that person to decide then literally flip a coin casue I really dont't think it matters. But I amy be shot for sayinga s such annd have been yelled at for real. The most important thing is to make sure you use technolgyo or software to do it for you or in my book y0ou are not a real programmer in fact aht is what wwe do is make things besiter autoemated sreamlined by telling computers to do work for us.  I promised myself when I learned about this debate I would never really get in the habit of hitting tab or spacces but when I hit CTRL S (save in your respective IDE ) the work would be done for you.
