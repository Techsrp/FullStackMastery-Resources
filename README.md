# FullStackMastery-Resources

###Purpose:  This is a collection of resources to help a beginner to intermediate level full stack developer
 become a master of their craft.

Baically I went to a coding boot camp and succesfully obtained a full time and full stack software developer job. I set the goal
to master my craft within 5 years to become an expert.  Just doing my work each day is not going to be enough I thought so 
I made this project to help me and figured others would benefit as well. *

**This is just a resource I do not claim ownership of anything on here.
