IN PROGRESS - CHECK BACK LATER 

# FullStackMastery-Resources
About me: After starting my first tutorial on Codecademy in January of 2017 it was about 1 year later when I was fully employed in a stable job as a Full Stack Software developer at a good wage. Proficiency and Mastery are two different things so this guide is dedicated to the latter.  To make Senior I must become a master at my craft.    

###Purpose:  A guide to improving your skills in Full Stack Software / Web Devlopment.

Baically I went to a coding boot camp and succesfully obtained a full time and full stack software developer job. I set the goal
to master my craft within 5 years to become an expert.  Just doing my work each day is not going to be enough I thought so 
I made this project to help me and figured others would benefit as well. *
