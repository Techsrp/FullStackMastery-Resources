1. been to a boot camp and want to porgess asa developer(that's me)
2. considering a bootcamp and wondering what will be taugt
3. want to be a self taught programmer 
4. got or getting a cs degree and want to learn about full stack web dvelpoemtn 
# FullStackMastery-Resources
Learning how to program outside of school is increasingly common. A 2015 Stack Overflow (an online community of programmers) survey found 48 percent of respondents did not have a degree in computer science. 1

Althoff, Cory. The Self-Taught Programmer: The Definitive Guide to Programming Professionally (p. 3). Triangle Connection LLC. Kindle Edition. 

Programming is writing instructions for a computer to execute. The instructions might tell the computer to print Hello, World!, scrape data from the Internet, or read the contents of a file and save them to a database. These instructions are called code.

What advantage does a bootcamp really give over self taught ? Should I do a bootcamp or self teach ?
If there were anyway to convince a person there is no need for a bootcamp I will find it. Imagine this: 1 year experience collecting everything and trying to tell someone everything they learned in bootcamp and full time emploemtn and many horus of googling and many courses and tutorials. All they tell you is to go on stakc overflow and for me - activites have some one or some other student to ask how to do it when sstuck . its the getting unstuck that is priceless with boootcamps.  one aleterntiave is active pteachers and ta  s on udemy and other sites treehouse tehese actually work pretty good but most do not have immediate feedback.

### Purpose:  A guide to improving your skills in Full Stack Software / Web Devlopment.
About me: After writing my first lines of code while taking a basic tutorial on Codecademy in January of 2017 it was about 1 year later when I was fully employed in a stable job as a Full Stack Software developer at a good wage. To do that I became proficient. Proficiency and Mastery are two different things so this guide is dedicated to the latter. To make Senior I must become a master at my craft. I set the goal to master my craft within 5 years and to become an expert.  Just doing my work each day is not going to be enough I thought so I made this project to help me and figured others would benefit as well. 

**This is just a resource I do not claim ownership of anything on here.

Making cool README

https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/
Open up Issues and drg a photo from the Harddrive or whever into the box and copy the link that auto generates that will display a real photo 

##### Skill: Workflow
This is intended to be the first most basic steps> If something is unfamilar ebleive me you will not want to skip over it. I have sat next to a 7 year veteran Senior dev and he did not know some of these keys 
Text Editor (IDE integrated development environment) - VS code is winning the fight according to some sources to be honest my personal opinoin is that overall its the easiet to use and is free. Webstorm is cool but cost moneya and has differnt hot keys and bascially is hard to learn from my epxerience people still using Sublime are jsut "don't want to change old shocoolers" which has its place for peopel that are really good and don't need more or new. If you want to use Sublime, Atom whatever then jsut google how to do all these things in that editor and you will be fine. But they all are great so that would be a worthwhile exericse.
pro tip:
Goal skill: be able to quickly move through all your files (code) find functions variables and their instances 
CTRL is the same as using the command key on Mac
CTRL + A Selects all
CTRL + G Go To a line number
CTRL + C ULTIMATE KEY OF ALL copy surprisingly high nuer of previous non coders dont reallu use this unless really good on a computer right lcik copy is super slow )
CTRL + V Paste 
SHIFT UP ARROW  move the line up or down not sure what this key is yet look it up
CTRL + D (esp useful remember to use Home and End keys to dynamically scroll to end or beginning of the lines text dynamically)
CTRL + ?/ (after selecting a block of code this will comment or uncomment if commented out the whole block or line) 
Save all key bidnings etc config for es lint and js options etc
CTRL + P file name search
CTRl + SHIFT + F find all occurences in all files in workspace
CTRL + Z
CTRL + SHIFT + Z
ALT + UP or ALT +  DOWN moves the current line up or down on the page 
double click on file at top or left and it will have its own window if you don't dot his and click another file without editing it will disappear and the tab be overwrittn. also the text goes italic whne not clicked twice
Code snippets
! tab boilerplate
for example 
<li*  turns into <li 3x etc 
drag the file from the top open status to the terminal and it puts the exact path there useful for ruhnning node etc. 

BOttm right click file type  GO and has al ot of these keys but its ont usuauolyll my first thoguht to go to each tab and go thorugh each one and knowing whtat it does and when to use it. 

GUI for git - bottom left branches and start and plus sign 
conflicts in purpole. 
CTTL + "~" open bottom tray with 4 optiosn . - mulitple terminals  
problems with file on bottom bar

Debugger for Node vs code
breakpoints
conitional breakpoint - freeze at certain number in loop for example hit count then expression .  
launch.json attach
smart step blackboxing not into dependencies my code only 
restart stackframe
column breakpoints on cahined on eline functions 
chrome and node in vs code seemlessly debug back end node and front end two runtimes

% key extentions for VS CODE 
Prettier - use a config as such
open in browser `techer.open-in-browser` - allows you to right click on an html file and load it in the browser
Prettier- Codeformatter `esbenp.prettier-vscode`
ES lint 
Beautify (says it works for React JSX but NOT that good ) 
Snippets of any language so for example when I type ccc tab it creates the whle component boiler plate in React. 
Jshint
Emmet - code completion and snipppets 
Can turn off temporarily 
 config : file for workspace 

INITIAL SET UP :
INSTALLS 


Terminal (for linus users use Terminator for teh ideal experience APple has similar)
Unix Commands - The termminal is where programmers live GUI are cool and great but you will need to get used to useing this great tool. Growing up all I rmember was run.exe such and such . So Windows or other OS is jsut a GUI for doing this 
command   Description
pwd       
ls
ls -a see hidden files like git 
ls -ll see who owns the file (if it ever errors messages give you that you don't have that permission it may be wise to check what user owns it for example)
cd [dir]
mkdir [dir]
rm
touch
cat
cd ~ home root
fg
killall node 
killall -9 npm
ipaddress stuff 
up key goes to last item and !! also repeats last command (this is very handy) down goes back down the line- Caution CTRL C stops the prcess from working so you have to use the mouse to copy and paste code 


Git HUb or bitbucket 

vim  - sometimes your temrianl will jump to some weird looking screen it could mean you entered into VIM its like a text editor inside the terminal - good for making quick changes and adding commands/code to computer config files etc 
esc : wq

nano 
ctrl x


HTML - code validation W3
Semantic HTML 
list of tags 
markup browser interprets to render the page 

live-server
icons brady stuff
cubernetes

 Getting oriented with Chrome
 Google Dev tools (Also Mozilla )
Copy the entire things by clicking copy outer html 
also can copy the enitre css document in a snese by useing CSS Steal extension and indivually by viewing each itme and its CSS
also you can find some of the JS

click the arrow to inpect an element
see the CSS associated and the classes break down - 
mobile responsive and tablet view 
Network . XHR 
all the images 
scarpers 
source
box model  up and down arrow keys - can manipulate and chage the page how ever you like inclding repalcing images and chanign text 

breakpoints 
console. (front end code only) remember the clear conosle siymbooll and persist logs so you get the logs even when chanign pages which can be useful 

10 Words you need to know well
MVC
IDE
DOM way of representing objects that can be defined via HTML and then later to be able to possibly interact with through a scripting lanague like JavaScript. HTML tags are known as nodes on the DOM. It can be ordered like a family tree chart.  Parents, children, siblings and so forth in a heirarchal order. So a ul would be the parent of the li and if it has 2 li then those are siblings. Decendants is a common word. 

Git or version control
99% of the commands I actually use in dev on the job ( not implying this is what should be or is done by others or even is the best set at all just plainly what I happen to use and sure it will evolve)
git init (creates a folder for git version control .git)
git add .
git commit -m "my message here"
git push 
git stash 
git stash apply
git merge
git reset HEad 
git log
git status
git checkout <brancname>
git checkout -b creates new branch fro one currently on - so use a development branch and each time start a new branch for     each fauter then merge it back to dev. and rebase before pushing 
  some others and linek to books and huge git hub repo of them 
git bisect 
git remote -v 
git pull
git log . see commit number you can reset to a commit and checkout a commit so do it often
git push --set-upstream origin nss-react-edit-billing

PREtiter ES LINT
WARNING PERSONAL SOAP BOX feel free to skip or not :
if you ever heard the joke ... I did from my CTO and Senior and other Junior Devs 2 or 4 spaces so I did some reaserch and top repos use 2 and 4 there are pros and cons to each. My philosophy is that I could careless jsut let the comoaony decide and if you are that person to decide then literally flip a coin casue I really dont't think it matters. But I amy be shot for sayinga s such annd have been yelled at for real. The most important thing is to make sure you use technolgyo or software to do it for you or in my book y0ou are not a real programmer in fact aht is what wwe do is make things besiter autoemated sreamlined by telling computers to do work for us.  I promised myself when I learned about this debate I would never really get in the habit of hitting tab or spacces but when I hit CTRL S (save in your respective IDE ) the work would be done for you.
