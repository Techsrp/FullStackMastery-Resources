## Purpose Statement
First of all I am seeking a position as a Senior Fullstack Engineer aka Web developer/ Sotware Developer. I hope that this process and help from others through this document may lead to helpining me be a MASTER at my craft. If you are considering a coding bootcamp I highly recommend saving this document as it will come in great use to you I guarantee it. If you are studyinig comuter scinece or are curois about antyhitng aforementioned this is the right palce. This is mostly a reference doc with an app to follow eventually. My wish would be that someone find this useful for them becoming a Fullstack Sofftware develloper. Be more direct here and simple with explanation after. Been to 3 bootcamps. 1. Paid Immersive FT 12 hours day for 3 months. 2. udemy past bootcamp teacher made his own course 3. a University Supported Professional Coding Bootcamp. 4. BOoks on holisitc full stack Web develoment:  5. 1 year experince coding and want to make senior in at best 3 years and maximum 7 years. I want to share the relazatively littel iI have learned but wish I knew more of when I started. Eveyrone that reads general psots out there on linked nin or caaeer stuf knows that Websd=veolopment is hot and growing so no better time to start tahn now. After my bootcamp I took some React courses from a great Udemy Pro name Stephen Grider. I also bought a course taught by an ex bootcamp insturctor which was an entire bootcamp on its own from what he took and said it was better than his bootcamp.  Both of these peole claim their students go on to get jobs.  I spent about $120 on about 10 courses. I was so furoius I had jsut soent well over 12000 for a 3 month bootcamp that I was motivated ot help others not have to do that.  DOn't get me wrong I actualy do not regret my expereince and recommend it to anyone needing structure BUT te reason I was mad is that I finally understood that the key beifnte is sommeone explainging to you when you are stuck.  You cannot esaily interact with the udemy professor althoguh the ones I have metninoed are agressive in getting realtivley quick respnsed ot you but even a few hours is costly.   

HOW TO READ THIS DOCS: SKILLS in gray header - taken from a real job psoting for a full stack engineerany paragprah or is askill I have learned on the job or in a bootcamp.  lnger than 2 sentences are bascailly my subjective expereince and thoughts. I only want to share exactly what has been to me as helpful or things i have learned and think can be learned fsater if shared in this format. Be a proficeint develpoer quicker liek havng a cheat sheet. Also a holistic collection all in one place ehich can be dangerous since it contains so much but I am doing it anyways.Where I have been and help others get there quicker. I have learned a langege and now several computer alnguesa =. determination is key.  One thing I have never hear donce is that programmin is easy. High paying jobs as it is. Bacically this is more like a small book - VOCAB sections. PRO TIPS is just a lesson learned type ofthigins highlevel overview sometimes and stuff I think is curucial \- I have read many books and conatin relatively  simialr type of content but my goal is not use words when I dont have to and let otehres do the talking and you do the googling seraching. that way you can find the ost current and select links you think lok good and in the process learn how to use google fu better and read docs  - 2 senetances of what is key inforamtion as to why you would google more of it. 
# Senior Full Stack Developer - (average salayr about 120k (plus or minus about 40k I have seen anywhere from 85 to 160) 
prove in startups to be a Full Stack Developer. Only a few are given freedom for what they do in the beginning stage.  almost the only way unless you have a cs degree and expereince 

a professional developer produces good quality code on a regular basis. 

Got an understanding on event processors and message queues like Celery and RabbitMQ. After that moved to Django. Acquainted with AWS, Nginx web servers. Developed code in CoffeeScript and Backbone JS. Played with Angular JS to create a chrome extension for my company. Currently writing a lot of JS code (client and server). Since I worked in few great startups, I got the freedom to work on all these things. I thank them from the depth of my heart.

Technology is changing briskly and sticking with same work for ages may deprecate your career options. You are more valuable HOW CAN I BE OF VALUE by knwoing all this well

Of course docotrs are highest paid and as well know have the most schooling. 

It is always said that being a software developer is a lifelong learning affair. Since the trends and technologies get the expire ticket often in the software field, one should be ready to cope up with a sudden change. It is a continuous treadmill where relaxing is seldom a choice.
Many software development & engineering jobs are flooding the current job market.
Technically speaking it is not a standard set by the industry. It is an evolutionary facet of skills. A full stack developer always tries to learn open source technologies to apply them in his/her job. In my opinion, full stack development is a minimalistic(at least) combination of following things
Front-end Development + Back-end Development + DevOps + Design
Apart from building web applications comfortably, a full stack developer should know how to deploy, optimize, automate the application.
SKIL working in a team and be able to finish tasks in the time.working with other teams busienss maagners product maganer CTO 
SKILL Choose the trivial good solution and improve it all the time
SKILL Can automate release cycles with the knowledge of Chef or Ansible. Automate logging and failure retrieval. rollbar sonar etc 
Having basic to medium level knowledge on hybrid mobile app development with JS, Chrome extensions and progressive web apps.

WHY whould I and is it fo rme? 
)*Avitivy One: Pick your top 10 companies you would work for.*  Gettting expereince at a lower tier company will help you get there.  Search those out on linked in for peoplpe that have those jobs in your 1st, 2nd or 3rd degree connections (go sign up now and add everuonen you know if you have not yet). Connect with them WITH a message for sure sayinig something easy going like whats it liek to work ther. INtorduce yourself aned say you'd love to connec ton linked in . Develop as many realtionship s as you can to widen you r network. Statistics for for getting a job due to netowrking "someone you know" is claimed to be the easiet or best way to get a job.  I have had little success with this but it has worked once. After selecting your 10 cmpanes reaching out to as many of the emplyees there as possible Sneior, jr. reecurieter,, maanger CTO anyone closly related to the job ando could help out.  I have found hiringn maangers names this way and then reached out to them on ilnkedd in etc. ANything helps in this regard. Even geteting interviews. The essentials include smart, passion for tech and a fierce creative porblem sover and team palyer. You cannot build great apps alone. like tech and computers. I would never count yourself out for age or past ecuation and experince. You now need to copy and paste all those job postings and see the common requiremetnes - the major ones. There is so much variety out ther you can NEVER know everything so accept that now.  Mainly knowing the core langauges and libraires are the key along with good problems solving skils and some other key skills. But is revloved around a languge. You specialize in a certain lanague or langauge set or even kow a few and become a master at a few. In the case of a full stack developer there are tons of lanauge. Right now I am a Javasciprt engieer who specailized in React Redux. and Node. with Mern known as a mern stack developer. So picking a tech stack you wantot specialize in the the first step.  Computer science knoweldge and technical challnege prowess and some sosft skills and culture fit assenstemten. This process is also known as "beginning with teh end in mind."  Also Knowing why and what you want is key in goal setting and life success. education level required: | B.S. Computer Science or equivalent experience 
Major/Field of study: | Computer Science or related field | Years: Minimum 5 years 
If youo are a CS major or grad. I am jealous I never thought about it in college for soem reaosn but did dabble with some free classes on app developmetn but Standfor Univierty. This documetn may help you if yu plan on going into Full Stack Web developerment or Javascirpt Enginner.  Those graduating in an realted filed Kudos to you you will have alsightly easier time finding a job on a relative scale form what I have seen. FOr the rest of us. we have to go off of Equivalent Experience.
So ainly teh main purpose of this docs is to learn more about what I have foudn off of real job postings and and cpmapre contracst with teh 1 year exp and needs I haveseen there and 4 bootcamps 
My goal: APple, Google, Symantec, Adobe, LDS Church, -

The fist question is how does the internet work ? https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm  Be sure to note teh resoureces section for further learnng.  if this psot from a Stanford Univeristy class does not help just Google it for 30 mins on Youtube and infographcs if you prefer. Again evertyhing in here is necesary knwoldeg for a ser=nior fullstack engineer if you want just the basics like preppring for a bootcamp maybe jsut spend 5 minutes on each of the more boring topics liek this one for  aorugh overview or better yet spend horus and don't even go to a bootcamp.

BFS (Breadth First Search) algotithsm 
DFS (Depth First Search)
BFS is a traversal algorithm which in the first turn visits all adjacent nodes to a root node and then starts digging deeper.
DFS is a traversal algorithm which first touches the bottom of maximum depth of first child node and then returns backs and starts the process from a second child.

Browserify tool like gulp
backend Can implement advanced queries and SQL Joins
what can a person with this skill do find 5 examples.  

Knows how to deploy his/her code on AWS EC2 with Apache2 or Nginx as a web server. Should have a working knowledge of Docker and Virtualization.


Can design a web application end to end with many loosely coupled components. Should be brave enough to suggest the architectural changes if he has a valid reasoning to do so.

*SKILLs: Proficient in Linux/Unix and comfortable with Mac/Windows* - 
OS 
MAC Windows Linux
Which one is best for a devleoper.  Well I think that is dependent on langauge and is subjective really.  The bust produccts are usually availble for all 3.  Mac comes with a better built in terminal bash than Windows and LInux comes pre installed with Python - I have seen on job psoting - experience with LInux as an actual skill, Windows has its own things like microsfot dev suite and you can get what is known as a virtual machine of windows - we may come backk to virtual machines later. Just  knwo the term. and know whatever your preference youo can still code.   some LInux basics - windwos mac in dev 
Fe thinigs to know. the command key is usually interchagnelable with the CTRL key on Windows and linux keyboards
LInux does not have a click install and is mostly run from the terminal - red hat stuff
LInus is free and 
*VOCAB: open source* 
some basic commands run in the termial 

sudo update
sudo chown -R pmurff:pmurff Security.js
sudo apt install
Sudo chmod a+x filepath  turns into execetuable

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them



<a name="Your-First-Code"></a>
## Your First Code and Laying a Programming Foundation
Just a thought for the self-taught (i.e. not obtaining a university degree in CS):

> Learning how to program outside of school is increasingly common. A 2015 Stack Overflow (an online community of programmers) survey found 48 percent of respondents did not have a degree in computer science. -Althoff, Cory. The Self-Taught Programmer: The Definitive Guide to Programming Professionally (p. 3). Triangle Connection LLC. Kindle Edition. 

What is programming ? 
> Programming is writing instructions for a computer to execute. The instructions might tell the computer to print Hello, World!, scrape data from the Internet, or read the contents of a file and save them to a database. These instructions are called code. 

For an example see this [Harvard CS 50 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUB-aJXquUA) WATCH: 17:45 -25:55. 
Main take away: computers can only do exactly what you tell them to do, no more no less. So learn to be very detailed and specific.

Before writing any code even Harvard kids start out on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) DO: Make a game or spend a few hours on [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us/learn). The main concepts you need to pick up on are statements(commands to the computer), loops(repeat something), conditions(like a fork in the road, if/else), Boolean Expressions(something is either true or false) and more.

After having covered some basic coding concepts you are ready to write real code. You can now jump into learning for free on all of these sites:  Google and YouTube have thousands of tutorials. Here are some pretty good ones:

Warning:https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance?language=en
 Be committed - Not one person ever told me coding (also known as programming) was easy 
 Be committed - Like leaning to speak a foriegn language coding requires study and practice and more practice 
 Be committed - It takes time and diligence and consitency lots of struggle and stretching for most  nd
ALWAYS BE CODING - once you learn a few concepts try to use it and play around make a folder called /sandbox and jsut make use of new things there. 
SKILLS: Google Fu  Skill in using search engines (especially Google) to quickly find useful information on the Internet
stack overflow with g - dont need to memorize everythign at first

FULL STACK define 
A Full-Stack Web Developer is someone who is able to work on both the front-end and back-end portions of an application. Front-end generally refers to the portion of an application the user will see or interact with, and the back-end is the part of the application that handles the logic, database interactions, user authentication, server configuration, etc. SO using the definitions above: Full Stack Web Development is writing the instructions for a web browser to interpret in order to render and make work a website on the internet. That includes what is known as back-end and front-end technologies as we learned above the client side and server side.

Start with [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn). You will need to register (it's free) then click into Web Development and bascially try to lick the top right to go to learn or catalog and start iwth HTML CSS and JavaScript or any language of choice. There are paid portions of the site but you can do a lot for free. The paid stuff includes quizzes and more activities.

READING CODE = if you know the vaculary and function  is very useful  so study for HTLM cool website jsut pull up google chrome and read the code. study it - if anything seems new google it and note it down copy and paste it in to a ongoing sandbox folder. 
READ ME TUROIALS - KEY IF the tutiral is well done it will work but iwth almost all cases code is exact so instaead of trying to make someting work form jsut reading it - alwasy clone the whole repo and get it working on your set up perfectly as intendded buyt he author then try to fit int into yoru project. I have seen this with auth alot its hard to get everypeice fit into your ongoing project but you need to confir it works as intended before you spend all the time tryin g ot use it.  SKILL - getting other peopls code to work with yours. Stack overlfow titel seems to be helpful but you have to adapt the working code to your own sitiation . varibale names and so forth. if you can alwasy copy and paste exact code and get working then refactro (defien this ) 
DOCS readings- the first several times looking at DOCS you are very bored and have a hard time udnersating super easily what is going on .  YOu will grow to love people who have good docs like react or express. Jquery.  Some docs make you wan to cry 
copy pasting snipepts of code and making sense and use of it. code is exact if you don't tell it ecalty and get everyithgn it will break and does often. 

SKILLS: writting celan mainaltabel sacaleb code. 



## Initial Setup Installing the Basics to Code on your local computer
Your ready to get coding you will need to set up yoru computer. I have used all three and found tutrials to have mixed results. So all iI can say is trial and error. Google one for your set up and good luck. So google HOW TO INSTALL ___ on LInux Mac OS Windows etc.

What advantage does a bootcamp really give over self taught ? Should I do a bootcamp or self teach ?
If there were anyway to convince a person there is no need for a bootcamp I will find it. Imagine this: 1 year experience collecting everything and trying to tell someone everything they learned in bootcamp and full time emploemtn and many horus of googling and many courses and tutorials. All they tell you is to go on stakc overflow and for me - activites have some one or some other student to ask how to do it when sstuck . its the getting unstuck that is priceless with boootcamps.  one aleterntiave is active pteachers and ta  s on udemy and other sites treehouse tehese actually work pretty good but most do not have immediate feedback.

“The art of readable code” (Boswell, Foucher). The fundamental theorem of readability : code should be written to minimize the time it would take for someone else to understand it !
Things you can do to imporve your code:
picking good names,(semantic meaningful names)  
writing good comments
formatting your code neatly (clean use of whitespace)

Linting — prevent bugs by not writing wrong code
In development, this is linting. Linters are software that analyses your code while you write it. It executes the partial code in the background and tells you when something is wrong. In the past you needed to install and configure linters yourself. These days, many come as extensions to editors with preconfigured rules. Rules that are the result of years of experts arguing and finding a consensus what makes sense. Google’s developer tools in Chrome give you similar insights. Reading through the results of linters is a good learning exercise. They not only tell you that something is wrong, but also why, what the effects are and how to fix it.

This editor is open source and comes with hundreds of extensions to help you with your tasks. It has linting built-in and allows for setting breakpoints in the editor itself. It contains a command line interface to do more hard-core tasks and has Git version control built in. There is something great about not having to jump from editor to browser to terminal.

### Purpose:  A guide to improving your skills in Full Stack Software / Web Devlopment.
About me: After writing my first lines of code while taking a basic tutorial on Codecademy in January of 2017 it was about 1 year later when I was fully employed in a stable job as a Full Stack Software developer at a good wage. To do that I became proficient. Proficiency and Mastery are two different things so this guide is dedicated to the latter. To make Senior I must become a master at my craft. I set the goal to master my craft within 5 years and to become an expert.  Just doing my work each day is not going to be enough I thought so I made this project to help me and figured others would benefit as well. 

**This is just a resource I do not claim ownership of anything on here.

##### Skill: Workflow
This is intended to be the first most basic steps> If something is unfamilar ebleive me you will not want to skip over it. I have sat next to a 7 year veteran Senior dev and he did not know some of these keys 
Text Editor (IDE integrated development environment) - VS code is winning the fight according to some sources to be honest my personal opinoin is that overall its the easiet to use and is free. Webstorm is cool but cost moneya and has differnt hot keys and bascially is hard to learn from my epxerience people still using Sublime are jsut "don't want to change old shocoolers" which has its place for peopel that are really good and don't need more or new. If you want to use Sublime, Atom whatever then jsut google how to do all these things in that editor and you will be fine. But they all are great so that would be a worthwhile exericse.
pro tip:
Goal skill: be able to quickly move through all your files (code) find functions variables and their instances 
CTRL is the same as using the command key on Mac
CTRL + A Selects all
CTRL + G Go To a line number
CTRL + C ULTIMATE KEY OF ALL copy surprisingly high nuer of previous non coders dont reallu use this unless really good on a computer right lcik copy is super slow )
CTRL + V Paste 
SHIFT UP ARROW  move the line up or down not sure what this key is yet look it up
CTRL + D (esp useful remember to use Home and End keys to dynamically scroll to end or beginning of the lines text dynamically)
CTRL + ?/ (after selecting a block of code this will comment or uncomment if commented out the whole block or line) 
Save all key bidnings etc config for es lint and js options etc
CTRL + P file name search
CTRl + SHIFT + F find all occurences in all files in workspace
CTRL + Z
CTRL + SHIFT + Z
ALT + UP or ALT +  DOWN moves the current line up or down on the page 
double click on file at top or left and it will have its own window if you don't dot his and click another file without editing it will disappear and the tab be overwrittn. also the text goes italic whne not clicked twice
Code snippets
! tab boilerplate
for example 
<li*  turns into <li 3x etc 
drag the file from the top open status to the terminal and it puts the exact path there useful for ruhnning node etc. 

BOttm right click file type  GO and has al ot of these keys but its ont usuauolyll my first thoguht to go to each tab and go thorugh each one and knowing whtat it does and when to use it. 

GUI for git - bottom left branches and start and plus sign 
conflicts in purpole. 
CTTL + "~" open bottom tray with 4 optiosn . - mulitple terminals  
problems with file on bottom bar

Debugger for Node vs code
breakpoints
conitional breakpoint - freeze at certain number in loop for example hit count then expression .  
launch.json attach
smart step blackboxing not into dependencies my code only 
restart stackframe
column breakpoints on cahined on eline functions 
chrome and node in vs code seemlessly debug back end node and front end two runtimes

AUTH 
[passport-with-sequelize-and-mysql](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/using-passport-with-sequelize-and-mysql--cms-27537)
karma.js
nightmare.js

% key extentions for VS CODE 
Prettier - use a config as such
open in browser `techer.open-in-browser` - allows you to right click on an html file and load it in the browser
Prettier- Codeformatter `esbenp.prettier-vscode`
ES lint 
Beautify (says it works for React JSX but NOT that good ) 
Snippets of any language so for example when I type ccc tab it creates the whle component boiler plate in React. 
Jshint
Emmet - code completion and snipppets 
Can turn off temporarily 
 config : file for workspace 

INITIAL SET UP :
INSTALLS 


Terminal (for linus users use Terminator for teh ideal experience APple has similar)
Unix Commands - The termminal is where programmers live GUI are cool and great but you will need to get used to useing this great tool. Growing up all I rmember was run.exe such and such . So Windows or other OS is jsut a GUI for doing this 
command   Description
pwd       
ls
ls -a see hidden files like git 
ls -ll see who owns the file (if it ever errors messages give you that you don't have that permission it may be wise to check what user owns it for example)
cd [dir]
mkdir [dir]
rm
touch
cat
cd ~ home root
fg
killall node 
killall -9 npm
ipaddress stuff 
up key goes to last item and !! also repeats last command (this is very handy) down goes back down the line- Caution CTRL C stops the prcess from working so you have to use the mouse to copy and paste code 


Git HUb or bitbucket 

vim  - sometimes your temrianl will jump to some weird looking screen it could mean you entered into VIM its like a text editor inside the terminal - good for making quick changes and adding commands/code to computer config files etc 
esc : wq

nano 
ctrl x


HTML - code validation W3
Semantic HTML 
list of tags 
markup browser interprets to render the page 

live-server
icons brady stuff
cubernetes

 Getting oriented with Chrome
 Google Dev tools (Also Mozilla )
Copy the entire things by clicking copy outer html 
also can copy the enitre css document in a snese by useing CSS Steal extension and indivually by viewing each itme and its CSS
also you can find some of the JS

click the arrow to inpect an element
see the CSS associated and the classes break down - 
mobile responsive and tablet view 
Network . XHR 
all the images 
scarpers 
source
box model  up and down arrow keys - can manipulate and chage the page how ever you like inclding repalcing images and chanign text 

breakpoints 
console. (front end code only) remember the clear conosle siymbooll and persist logs so you get the logs even when chanign pages which can be useful 

10 Words you need to know well
MVC
IDE
DOM way of representing objects that can be defined via HTML and then later to be able to possibly interact with through a scripting lanague like JavaScript. HTML tags are known as nodes on the DOM. It can be ordered like a family tree chart.  Parents, children, siblings and so forth in a heirarchal order. So a ul would be the parent of the li and if it has 2 li then those are siblings. Decendants is a common word. 

Git or version control
99% of the commands I actually use in dev on the job ( not implying this is what should be or is done by others or even is the best set at all just plainly what I happen to use and sure it will evolve)
git init (creates a folder for git version control .git)
git add .
git commit -m "my message here"
git push 
git stash 
git stash apply
git merge
git reset HEad 
git log
git status
git checkout <brancname>
git checkout -b creates new branch fro one currently on - so use a development branch and each time start a new branch for     each fauter then merge it back to dev. and rebase before pushing 
  some others and linek to books and huge git hub repo of them 
git bisect 
git remote -v 
git pull
git log . see commit number you can reset to a commit and checkout a commit so do it often
git push --set-upstream origin nss-react-edit-billing

PREtiter ES LINT
WARNING PERSONAL SOAP BOX feel free to skip or not :
if you ever heard the joke ... I did from my CTO and Senior and other Junior Devs 2 or 4 spaces so I did some reaserch and top repos use 2 and 4 there are pros and cons to each. My philosophy is that I could careless jsut let the comoaony decide and if you are that person to decide then literally flip a coin casue I really dont't think it matters. But I amy be shot for sayinga s such annd have been yelled at for real. The most important thing is to make sure you use technolgyo or software to do it for you or in my book y0ou are not a real programmer in fact aht is what wwe do is make things besiter autoemated sreamlined by telling computers to do work for us.  I promised myself when I learned about this debate I would never really get in the habit of hitting tab or spacces but when I hit CTRL S (save in your respective IDE ) the work would be done for you.

Principles of Debugging
Error messages 
finding out where the code stopped - this is easy most the time - its the bugs wehre you don't know this is the worst 
once you find out where it stopped you can then debug for real.  10 most common erros. 
knowing all variables in play 
checking syntax and spelling (this I have learned is an error mostly made with beginners) good code editors can prevent most of this disodence
